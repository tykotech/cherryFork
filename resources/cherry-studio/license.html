        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Refers to any organization (including companies, non-profits, government agencies, educational institutions,
          etc.) where the total number of individuals who can access, use, or in any way directly or indirectly benefit
          from the functionality of this software (Cherry Studio) does not exceed 10. This includes, but is not limited
          to, developers, testers, operations staff, end-users, and indirect users via integrated systems.

          Organizations of 10 or Fewer</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>If you are an individual user, or if your organization meets the "10 or Fewer Individuals" definition
            above, you are free to use, modify, and distribute Cherry Studio under the terms of the
            <strong>AGPLv3</strong>. The full text of the AGPLv3 can be found at <a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html"

          </li>
          <li><strong>Core Obligation:</strong> A key requirement of the AGPLv3 is that if you modify Cherry Studio and
            make it available over a network, or distribute the modified version, you must provide the <strong>complete
              corresponding source code</strong> under the AGPLv3 license to the recipients. Even if you qualify under
            the "10 or Fewer Individuals" rule, if you wish to avoid this source code disclosure obligation, you will
            need to obtain a Commercial License (see below).</li>
          <li>Please read and understand the full terms of the AGPLv3 carefully before use.</li>

          Individuals, or Users Needing to Avoid AGPLv3 Obligations</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Mandatory Requirement:</strong> If your organization does <strong>not</strong> meet the "10 or
            Fewer Individuals" definition above (i.e., 11 or more individuals can access, use, or benefit from the
            software), you <strong>must</strong> contact us to obtain and execute a Commercial License to use Cherry
            Studio.</li>
          <li><strong>Voluntary Option:</strong> Even if your organization meets the "10 or Fewer Individuals"
            condition, if your intended use case <strong>cannot comply with the terms of the AGPLv3</strong>
            (particularly the obligations regarding <strong>source code disclosure</strong>), or if you require specific
            commercial terms <strong>not offered</strong> by the AGPLv3 (such as warranties, indemnities, or freedom
            from copyleft restrictions), you also <strong>must</strong> contact us to obtain and execute a Commercial
            License.</li>
          <li><strong>Common scenarios requiring a Commercial License include (but are not limited to):</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Your organization has more than 10 individuals who can access, use, or benefit from the software.</li>
              <li>(Regardless of organization size) You wish to distribute a modified version of Cherry Studio but
                <strong>do not want</strong> to disclose the source code of your modifications under AGPLv3.
              </li>
              <li>(Regardless of organization size) You wish to provide a network service (SaaS) based on a modified
                version of Cherry Studio but <strong>do not want</strong> to provide the modified source code to users
                of the service under AGPLv3.</li>
              <li>(Regardless of organization size) Your corporate policies, client contracts, or project requirements
                prohibit the use of AGPLv3-licensed software or mandate closed-source distribution and confidentiality.
