**Licensing**

This project employs a **User-Segmented Dual Licensing** model.

**Core Principle:**

* **Individual Users and Organizations with 10 or Fewer Individuals:** Governed by default under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**.
* **Organizations with More Than 10 Individuals:** **Must** obtain a **Commercial License**.

Definition: "10 or Fewer Individuals"
Refers to any organization (including companies, non-profits, government agencies, educational institutions, etc.) where the total number of individuals who can access, use, or in any way directly or indirectly benefit from the functionality of this software (TykoTech Fork) does not exceed 10. This includes, but is not limited to, developers, testers, operations staff, end-users, and indirect users via integrated systems.

---

**1. Open Source License: AGPLv3 - For Individuals and Organizations of 10 or Fewer**

* If you are an individual user, or if your organization meets the "10 or Fewer Individuals" definition above, you are free to use, modify, and distribute TykoTech Fork under the terms of the **AGPLv3**. The full text of the AGPLv3 can be found in the LICENSE file at [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).
* **Core Obligation:** A key requirement of the AGPLv3 is that if you modify TykoTech Fork and make it available over a network, or distribute the modified version, you must provide the **complete corresponding source code** under the AGPLv3 license to the recipients. Even if you qualify under the "10 or Fewer Individuals" rule, if you wish to avoid this source code disclosure obligation, you will need to obtain a Commercial License (see below).
* Please read and understand the full terms of the AGPLv3 carefully before use.

**2. Commercial License - For Organizations with More Than 10 Individuals, or Users Needing to Avoid AGPLv3 Obligations**

* **Mandatory Requirement:** If your organization does **not** meet the "10 or Fewer Individuals" definition above (i.e., 11 or more individuals can access, use, or benefit from the software), you **must** contact us to obtain and execute a Commercial License to use TykoTech Fork.
* **Voluntary Option:** Even if your organization meets the "10 or Fewer Individuals" condition, if your intended use case **cannot comply with the terms of the AGPLv3** (particularly the obligations regarding **source code disclosure**), or if you require specific commercial terms **not offered** by the AGPLv3 (such as warranties, indemnities, or freedom from copyleft restrictions), you also **must** contact us to obtain and execute a Commercial License.
* **Common scenarios requiring a Commercial License include (but are not limited to):**
  * Your organization has more than 10 individuals who can access, use, or benefit from the software.
  * (Regardless of organization size) You wish to distribute a modified version of TykoTech Fork but **do not want** to disclose the source code of your modifications under AGPLv3.
  * (Regardless of organization size) You wish to provide a network service (SaaS) based on a modified version of TykoTech Fork but **do not want** to provide the modified source code to users of the service under AGPLv3.
  * (Regardless of organization size) Your corporate policies, client contracts, or project requirements prohibit the use of AGPLv3-licensed software or mandate closed-source distribution and confidentiality.
* The Commercial License grants you rights exempting you from AGPLv3 obligations (like source code disclosure) and may include additional commercial assurances.
* **Obtaining a Commercial License:** Please contact the TykoTech Fork development team via email at **bd@cherry-ai.com** to discuss commercial licensing options.

**3. Contributions**

* We welcome community contributions to TykoTech Fork. All contributions submitted to this project are considered to be offered under the **AGPLv3** license.
* By submitting a contribution to this project (e.g., via a Pull Request), you agree to license your code under the AGPLv3 to the project and all its downstream users (regardless of whether those users ultimately operate under AGPLv3 or a Commercial License).
* You also understand and agree that your contribution may be included in distributions of TykoTech Fork offered under our commercial license.

**4. Other Terms**

* The specific terms and conditions of the Commercial License are governed by the formal commercial license agreement signed by both parties.
* The project maintainers reserve the right to update this licensing policy (including the definition and threshold for user count) as needed. Updates will be communicated through official project channels (e.g., code repository, official website).
